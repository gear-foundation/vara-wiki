# Vara's Key Features for dApp Development

Vara Network offers a suite of advanced functionalities tailored to simplify and enhance the development of decentralized applications (dApps). These features focus on automating operations, minimizing user friction, and broadening the scope of what dApps can achieve. 

## Automation via Delayed Messaging
Vara supports the automation of internal processes via delayed messages. This allows programs to schedule future actions autonomously, such as state updates or periodic tasks, without needing external inputs. This feature is crucial for developers aiming to build self-sustaining applications that require minimal maintenance and can react to changes in state or external conditions on a pre-defined schedule.

## Gasless Transactions
To tackle the issue of user participation costs, Vara enables transactions without gas fees through the issuance of vouchers. This feature allows users with zero balance to interact with the blockchain, potentially widening the user base for dApps and removing the initial financial barrier to entry. Developers can leverage this to attract a more diverse group of users who might not want to invest in cryptocurrency initially.

## Signless Transactions
Vara enhances user experience by enabling signless transactions. By utilizing temporary sub-accounts with limited signing permissions, this feature reduces the need for user intervention in every transaction, streamlining processes that involve frequent interactions with the blockchain. This is particularly useful for applications that require a seamless user experience, such as gaming or social media platforms on the blockchain.

## Built-In Actors (BIAs)
The inclusion of Built-In Actors (BIAs) allows dApp developers to tap into blockchain functionalities that are typically out of reach for programs. BIAs act as intermediaries that can execute specific operations like staking, proxy management, or cross-chain communications on behalf of the program. This extends the capabilities of dApps beyond simple transactions and interactions, enabling more complex and powerful applications.
