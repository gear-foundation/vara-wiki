title: Gear-JS Wallet Connect
---

## Description

A React library to connect supported Substrate-based wallets in a standardized and consistent way across decentralized applications.

## Installation

```npm
npm install @gear-js/wallet-connect @gear-js/react-hooks @gear-js/ui @gear-js/vara-ui
```

## Getting started

### Configure API

Before using `@gear-js/wallet-connect`, make sure to configure [`@gear-js/react-hooks`](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear-js/tree/main/utils/gear-hooks#readme) in your project according to its documentation. This setup is required for API connection and account management.

### Configure UI

Depending on your chosen theme, you must also install and configure the corresponding UI library styles:

- For the **`vara`** theme (default), follow the [`@gear-js/vara-ui`](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear-js/tree/main/utils/vara-ui#readme) documentation to set up global styles.
- For the **`gear`** theme, follow the [`@gear-js/ui`](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear-js/tree/main/utils/gear-ui#readme) documentation to set up global styles (typically via your `index.scss`).

## Components

### Wallet

A React component that displays the current account or wallet connection button, and (optionally) the account’s total balance. It uses [`useAccount`](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear-js/tree/main/utils/gear-hooks#useaccount) from `@gear-js/react-hooks` to manage account state and modal visibility for wallet actions.

<Callout type="info" title="Standard Wallet Component">
    This is a generic, **ready-to-use component** for wallet management. It handles:

    * **Connection:** Managing the wallet connection flow.
    * **Account Display:** Showing the currently active account.
    * **Modals:** Built-in modal handling for selection and management.

    For most dApps, this component is the quickest way to integrate wallet functionality.
</Callout>

#### Props

- `theme` (`'gear' | 'vara'`, optional): UI theme for the wallet controls. Defaults to `'vara'`.
- `displayBalance` (`boolean`, optional): Whether to show the account’s total balance. Defaults to `true`.

#### Usage Example

```jsx
import { Wallet } from '@gear-js/wallet-connect';

import Logo from './logo.svg?react';

function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <Logo />
      <Wallet />
    </header>
  );
}

export { Header };
```

### WalletModal

A React modal component for managing wallet connections and account selection. It provides a user interface for connecting to supported wallets, switching between accounts, copying addresses, and logging out. This component is used internally by the [Wallet](/docs/api/tooling/wallet-js#wallet) component.

<Callout type="idea" title="Custom Wallet Control">
    Use this component if you need to open the wallet modal **programmatically** or create a **custom** button for account management.

    Unlike the generic `Wallet` component, this one gives you full control over the modal's behavior and appearance.
</Callout>

#### Props

- `theme` (`'gear' | 'vara'`, optional): UI theme for the modal. Defaults to `'vara'`.
- `close` (`() => void`): Function to close the modal.

#### Usage Example

```jsx
import { WalletModal } from '@gear-js/wallet-connect';

function CustomWalletButton() {
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);

  const openModal = () => setIsModalOpen(true);
  const closeModal = () => setIsModalOpen(false);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={openModal}>Open Wallet Modal</button>

      {isModalOpen && <WalletModal theme="vara" close={closeModal} />}
    </>
  );
}
```
