title: Data Encoding/Decoding
---

To optimize how data is sent and received over the network, Gear uses the [`parity-scale-codec`](https://docs.rs/parity-scale-codec) - a Rust implementation of the SCALE Codec. This codec is used by the Substrate nodes' internal runtime. SCALE is a lightweight format that enables the serialization and deserialization of data. Encoding (and decoding) data using SCALE makes it highly suitable for resource-constrained execution environments like blockchain runtimes and low-power/low-memory devices.

To use the SCALE codec in a program, add it to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]

// ...
codec = { package = "parity-scale-codec", version = "3.6", default-features = false }
```

```rust
use codec::{Decode, Encode};

#[derive(Encode, Decode)]
enum MyType {
    MyStruct { field: ... },
    ...
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="Encoding and Decoding Traits">
    The `Encode` and `Decode` traits are required when using standard `gstd` methods:
    [`msg::load`](https://docs.rs/gstd/latest/gstd/msg/fn.load.html), [`msg::send`](https://docs.rs/gstd/latest/gstd/msg/fn.send.html), [`msg::reply`](https://docs.rs/gstd/latest/gstd/msg/fn.reply.html), and [`msg::send_for_reply`](https://docs.rs/gstd/latest/gstd/msg/fn.send_for_reply.html).

    **Note on Byte Methods:**
    When using byte-level operations like [`msg::load_bytes`](https://docs.rs/gstd/latest/gstd/msg/fn.load_bytes.html), [`msg::send_bytes`](https://docs.rs/gstd/latest/gstd/msg/fn.send_bytes.html) or [`msg::reply_bytes`](https://docs.rs/gstd/latest/gstd/msg/fn.reply_bytes.html), encoding/decoding is not required as you are working directly with raw data.

## `scale-info`

[`scale-info`](https://docs.rs/scale-info/) is a library to describe Rust types, intended for providing information about the structure of encodable SCALE types.

The definitions provide third-party tools (e.g., a UI client) with information about how to decode types agnostic of language. The interface that uses `scale-info` for Gear programs is called **metadata**. It defines incoming and outgoing types for all necessary entry points and allows programs and the client part to understand each other.

    For a deeper dive into program configuration, see the [Metadata Overview](/docs/build/gstd/metadata) guide.

To use `scale-info` in a project:

```toml
[dependencies]

// ...
scale-info = { version = "2.9", default-features = false, features = ["derive"] }
```
