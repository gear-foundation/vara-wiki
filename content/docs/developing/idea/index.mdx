The Gear IDEA portal is a convenient tool designed to familiarize users with the Gear platform. It offers program and smart contract developers the easiest and fastest way to work with their programs on the Vara Network (mainnet and testnet) directly in their browser without additional configuration.

This application supports all interactions with programs on the network, including uploading programs and codes, reading program states, sending messages, and more. Additionally, it allows managing accounts, balances, events, vouchers, and more.

You can start experimenting right now at **https://idea.gear-tech.io/**.
