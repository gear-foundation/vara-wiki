title: Proxy-Based Program Update Approach

## About

A program uploaded to the blockchain from specific source code represents a unique instance with a clearly defined on-chain address. A program uploaded from the same source code will become a separate instance with its own unique address, even if the logic remains identical. While the program’s state can change according to the defined business logic, there is no technical way to directly update the logic of an already uploaded program while preserving its unique address in the network.

Programs often require updates to add new functionality or fix errors, making the ability to update a program’s business logic essential. Updating a program involves modifying the on-chain program in a way that avoids mandatory updates to other components or dependencies, such as the frontend, backend, external links, and more.

**Upgrade Proxy programs** are a well-known design pattern in blockchain development that address upgrade challenges. This approach enables the delegation of function calls to a separate logic program. The pattern separates business logic from the program’s state and address, allowing upgrades or modifications to the logic without affecting the existing state or deployed address.

This [example](https://github.com/gear-foundation/dapps/tree/master/contracts/upgrade-proxy) demonstrates a practical implementation of an upgrade proxy program designed to forward user interactions to a logic program. The upgrade proxy handles two primary responsibilities:

1. Forwarding state-modifying messages while preserving the original sender's address.
2. Handling state queries to retrieve data from the logic program.
This design also supports logic program upgrades, ensuring flexibility and compatibility while maintaining administrative control.

## Program logic

### Message Forwarding
1. **State-Modifying Messages**
The `execute_msg` function forwards a state-modifying message to the logic program. It includes the original sender's address (`msg::source()`) in the payload for transparency and accountability.
```rust title="proxy-example/proxy/app/src/lib.rs"
pub async fn execute_msg(&mut self, bytes: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8> {
    let original_sender = Some(msg::source());
    let sender_encoded = original_sender.encode();
    let mut new_payload = bytes.clone();
    new_payload.extend(sender_encoded);
    msg::send_bytes_for_reply(
        self.get().logic_address,
        new_payload,
        msg::value(),
        REPLY_DEPOSIT,
    )
    .expect("Error during message sending")
    .await
    .expect("Error during getting the reply")
}
```
2. **State Queries**
The `read_state` function handles read-only queries, forwarding requests to the logic program without modifying its state.
```rust title="proxy-example/proxy/app/src/lib.rs"
pub async fn read_state(&self, bytes: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8> {
    msg::send_bytes_for_reply(self.get().logic_address, bytes, 0, 0)
        .expect("Error during message sending")
        .await
        .expect("Error during getting the reply")
}
```
### Program's Logic Upgrade
The upgrade proxy includes an `update_logic` function that allows the admin to change the logic program address.
```rust title="proxy-example/proxy/app/src/lib.rs"
pub fn update_logic(&mut self, new_logic_address: ActorId, msg_source: Option<ActorId>) {
    self.check_if_proxy();
    let msg_source = self.get_msg_source(msg_source);
    self.only_admin(msg_source);
    self.get_mut().logic_address = new_logic_address;
}
```

### Creating a Proxy-Compatible Program
Making a program compatible with a proxy requires implementing specific features that enable the proxy to forward messages effectively while preserving the original sender's address. The following outlines the key adjustments and features incorporated into the [`Counter` program](https://github.com/gear-foundation/dapps/tree/master/contracts/proxy-example/counter) to support a proxy.

#### Key Features of a Proxy-Compatible Program
1. Upgrade Proxy Address Registration:
The program must allow an admin to set the address of the proxy, which is responsible for forwarding messages.
2. Forwarded Sender (`msg_source()`):

    When the proxy forwards a message, it includes the original sender's address (`msg_source()`). The program verifies this sender and distinguishes between direct and proxied calls.
```rust title="proxy-example/counter/app/src/lib.rs"
fn get_msg_source(&self, msg_source: Option<ActorId>) -> ActorId {
    if self.get().proxy_address.is_some() {
        msg_source.expect("msg_source must be set through proxy")
    } else {
        msg::source()
    }
}
```
3. Forwarding Logic in Proxy-Compatible Methods:

    To ensure compatibility with a proxy, key methods in the program include an additional parameter of type `Option<ActorId>`. This parameter (`msg_source`) specifies the actual sender of the message:
    - If the program is called via a proxy:
The proxy forwards the `ActorId` of the original sender, and `msg_source` will be `Some(ActorId)`.
    - If the program is called directly:
`msg_source` will be `None`, and the program defaults to using `msg::source()` to determine the sender.
```rust title="proxy-example/counter/app/src/lib.rs"
pub fn contribute(&mut self, msg_source: Option<ActorId>) -> u128 {
    self.check_if_proxy();
    let msg_source = self.get_msg_source(msg_source); 
    let amount = msg::value();
    assert!(amount > 0, "Contribution must be greater than zero");
    
    let state = self.get_mut();
    let contribution = state.contributions.entry(msg_source).or_insert(0);
    *contribution += amount;
    state.value += amount;
    state.value
}
```

### State Migration
State migration allows the transfer of critical program data from an old program to a new one, enabling smooth upgrades while preserving important state variables. In this example, the migration involves exporting specific fields (`value`, `limit`, and `contributions`) and importing them into a new instance of the program.
1. Exporting State
The `export_migration_state` function serializes only the necessary fields from the program's state and encodes them for transfer.
```rust title="proxy-example/counter/app/src/lib.rs"
/// Exports the essential state for migration.
/// Only includes `value`, `limit`, and `contributions` fields.
pub fn export_migration_state(&self) -> Vec<u8> {
    let state = self.get();
    let export_data = (state.value, state.limit, state.contributions.clone());
    export_data.encode()
}
```
2. Importing State
The `import_migration_state` function allows a new program to decode and load the state exported from the old program.
```rust title="proxy-example/counter/app/src/lib.rs"
/// Imports the state from the previous program.
/// Decodes and applies `value`, `limit`, and `contributions` fields.
pub fn import_migration_state(&mut self, encoded_state: Vec<u8>) {
    let (value, limit, contributions) =
        <(u128, u128, BTreeMap<ActorId, u128>)>::decode(&mut encoded_state.as_ref())
            .expect("Failed to decode migration state");

    let state = self.get_mut();

    state.value = value;
    state.limit = limit;
    state.contributions = contributions;
}
```
### Kill Function
The kill function is used to stop the execution of the current program and transfer its remaining balance to a specified inheritor (e.g., a newly deployed program). This function is typically invoked by the admin as part of an upgrade process.
```rust title="proxy-example/counter/app/src/lib.rs"
/// Stops the execution of the current program and transfers its remaining balance
/// to the specified inheritor (e.g., a new program).
pub async fn kill(&mut self, inheritor: ActorId, msg_source: Option<ActorId>) {
        self.check_if_proxy();
        let msg_source = self.get_msg_source(msg_source);
        self.only_admin(msg_source);
        exec::exit(inheritor);
    }

```
#### Considerations for State Migration
While state migration is essential for upgrading programs, developers must address the following challenge:

1. **Storage Size Limitations**:
    - Programs with large or complex states may exceed the gas limit for a single transaction, making it impossible to migrate all data in one go:

To address this, developers can implement partial migration, which enables the state to be migrated in smaller, manageable chunks.
