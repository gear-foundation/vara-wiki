title: Connect Account
---

In general, sending messages to programs, including uploading them on-chain, requires a connected Vara account with enough tokens for gas fees.

To start using the IDEA portal, click the `Connect` button at the top right, select a wallet, and choose an account. If you don't have an account yet, refer to the next article.

You can easily switch between your accounts and supported wallets via the currently connected account button.

## Get test balance

For development and testing, switch to the Vara Testnet and get a test balance in TVARA. Click the `Get Test Balance` button, solve the captcha, and test tokens will appear in your balance. Test tokens can be requested once a day.

## Transfer balance

The `Transfer Balance` option allows you to transfer VARA tokens (or TVARA on the testnet) from the currently connected account to any other specified account. Specify the account address in Vara or HEX format, the amount of tokens, and sign the transaction.
