title: Vara Node
description: "This guide covers the steps required to install and run the Vara node."
---

## Introduction

There are two ways to get started with the Vara node. First, download a pre-built binary file and run it. Second, compile the binary file and configure it manually. Using a ready-made build is a quick and convenient way to get started, as it skips the installation of Rust and all its dependencies and the node compiling process. Compiling the node from scratch may take about twenty minutes or more, depending on hardware.

## System Requirements

• CPU: 2 vCPUs @ ~3.4 GHz (Intel Ice Lake or equivalent) • Memory: 8 GB RAM • Storage: 80 GB SSD

## Install with Pre-built Binary

Depending on the operating system, download the latest release build of the node from https://get.gear.rs:

<Callout type="idea" title="Need the Latest Features?">
    If you require cutting-edge functionality before it hits the stable release, you can use our [nightly builds](https://get.gear.rs/#gear-nightly).

    **Note:** Nightly versions may be less stable than official releases.
</Callout>


## Compile Node Manually

Compiling the build will take some time and requires the installation of some dependencies.

<Callout type="warn" title="Windows Compatibility">
    - Windows users often face issues with Rust dependencies and build tools.
    - We **strongly recommend** using Linux or macOS for compiling Vara nodes and programs.

    **Tip:** If you are on Windows, using **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is the best way to ensure a stable development environment.
</Callout>


### Prerequisites

Linux users should generally install `GCC` and `Clang`, according to their distribution’s documentation. Additionally, the `binaryen` toolset, which contains the required `wasm-opt` tool, should be installed.

For example, on Ubuntu use:

```bash
sudo apt install -y clang build-essential binaryen cmake protobuf-compiler
```

On macOS, get a compiler toolset and `binaryen` by running:

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install binaryen
```

### Install Rust

If Rust is already installed, skip this step.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Reboot the terminal after installation.

### Install Wasm Toolchains

```bash
rustup toolchain add nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

### Clone Gear Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gear-tech/gear.git
cd gear
# Checkout to the latest release tag
git checkout v1.2.1 -b release-1.2.1
```

<Callout type="info" title="Using the Master Branch">
    To access the latest or experimental Gear Protocol functions, compile the node from the `master` branch.

    If you have switched to another branch, you can return to `master` using:

    ```bash
    git checkout master
    ```
</Callout>

### Compile

```bash
cargo build -p gear-cli --release
```

or

```bash
make node-release
```

<Callout type="note" title="Build Output Location">
    The compiled binary is located at: `target/release/gear`

    To navigate to the output folder, run:
    ```bash
    cd target/release
    ```
</Callout>

## Run Vara Node

<Callout type="info" title="Starting the Node">
    Regardless of how you obtained the binary, navigate to its directory and run the node to connect to the **Vara Testnet**:

    ```bash
    ./gear
    ```
</Callout>

To run the Vara node in dev mode:

```bash
./gear --dev
```

## Command Flags and Options

```bash
gear [subcommand] [options]
```

- `--chain=testnet`

  Connect the node to the test network (default option).

- `--chain=vara`

  Connect the node to the Vara network.

- `--dev`

  Run a local node in development mode for testing purposes. This node will not be connected to any external network and will store the state in temporary storage.

- `purge-chain`

  Remove storage of the selected chain type. Specify the chain connection type `--chain=testnet`, `--chain=vara`, or `--dev`.

- `help`, `--help`

  Print the available subcommands/options or the help of the given subcommand.

## Special Environment Variables

To run the Vara node with logs from contracts:

```bash
RUST_LOG="gwasm=debug" gear [subcommand] [options]
```
