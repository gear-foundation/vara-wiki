# Verify & Inspect

After deploying your program, verify it on Ethereum block explorers and inspect its state through multiple tools.

## Explorer Verification

### Etherscan

Find your Mirror contract on [Hoodi Etherscan](https://hoodi.etherscan.io). Search by the Mirror address returned during [program creation](/docs/vara-eth/deploy/create-program-instance).

**Without ABI:**  
Base Mirror methods visible — `sendMessage`, `sendReply`, `executableBalanceTopUp`, `claimValue`

**With ABI:**  
Under "Write as Proxy" and "Read as Proxy", your program's custom methods appear with decoded parameters

### Key Events

On your Mirror contract's "Events" tab:

| Event                             | Meaning                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `MessageQueueingRequested`        | Message was queued for your program         |
| `ExecutableBalanceTopUpRequested` | wVARA was deposited for execution           |
| `StateChanged`                    | Program state was updated (batch committed) |
| `Message`                         | Program sent an outgoing message            |
| `Reply`                           | Program replied to a message                |
| `ValueClaimed`                    | Value was claimed from the program          |

## Read Program State

### CLI

```bash
ethexe tx query "$PROGRAM_ID" \
  --ethereum-rpc "$RPC" \
  --ethereum-router "$ROUTER" \
  --sender "$SENDER"
```

### TypeScript SDK (sails-js)

```typescript
import { MyProgram } from './generated';

const program = new MyProgram(provider, PROGRAM_ADDRESS);

// Read-only queries — free, no gas
const counter = await program.counter.get();
const balance = await program.token.balanceOf(userAddress);
```

### Etherscan (with ABI)

If deployed with ABI, navigate to the Mirror address on Etherscan and use the "Read as Proxy" tab to call read-only methods directly in the browser.

## State Hash

Every program's Mirror contract stores a `stateHash` — a cryptographic commitment to the program's full state.

```typescript
const mirror = new ethers.Contract(mirrorAddress, mirrorAbi, provider);
const stateHash = await mirror.stateHash();
```

<Callout type="note" title="State Guarantee">
  The `stateHash` guarantees that the state stored by executors matches what's committed on L1. Any dispute about
  program state can be resolved by comparing hashes.

## Gear IDEA

<Callout type="note" title="Specialized Interface">
  [Gear IDEA](https://idea.gear-tech.io) is specialized for Gear programs. A dedicated Vara.eth interface may become
  available in the future.
</Callout>

Web UI for inspecting programs:

- Browse deployed programs and their code IDs
- View program state and message history
- Send messages through the web interface
- Inspect IDL definitions

## Checking Program Health

A healthy, active program should show:

**Valid code** — `CodeGotValidated(codeId, true)` event exists on the Router  
**Initialized** — At least one `StateChanged` event after the init message  
**Funded** — At least one successful `ExecutableBalanceTopUpRequested` event and continued `StateChanged` activity  
**Processing** — Recent `StateChanged` events when messages are sent
