# Getting wVARA

## Testnet

### Faucet

The easiest way to get testnet wVARA:

1. Go to [eth.vara.network/testnet](https://eth.vara.network/testnet)
2. Connect your wallet (must be on Hoodi testnet)
3. Click "Request tokens"
4. Receive testnet wVARA and Hoodi ETH

The faucet provides enough tokens for development and testing. You can request multiple times with a cooldown between requests.

### Manual Bridge (Testnet)

If you have testnet VARA on Vara Network, you can bridge it:

1. Visit the bridge interface at [eth.vara.network](https://eth.vara.network)
2. Connect both Vara and Ethereum wallets
3. Select amount to bridge
4. Approve and confirm the bridge transaction
5. Wait for bridge confirmation (~15-30 minutes)
6. wVARA appears in your Ethereum wallet

For a detailed bridge walkthrough, see the [Bridge User Guide](/docs/vara-network/bridge/bridge_guide).

## Mainnet

<Callout type="note" title="Coming Soon">
    Vara.eth mainnet is not yet live. The following describes the expected mechanics.

### Bridge from Vara Network

The primary way to get wVARA:

1. Acquire VARA on the Vara Network (exchanges, staking rewards, etc.) — see [Vara Network Tokenomics](/docs/vara-network/tokenomics)
2. Use the official [bridge](/docs/vara-network/bridge) to wrap VARA -> wVARA on Ethereum
3. wVARA is minted 1:1 against locked VARA

For the technical details of the bridge, see the [Bridge Technical Overview](/docs/vara-network/bridge/bridge_technical).

### DEX Trading

Once wVARA has liquidity on Ethereum:
- Trade on Uniswap, Curve, or other DEXes
- Pair with ETH, USDC, or other tokens
- Standard ERC-20 trading experience

### Validator Rewards

Validators earn wVARA for:
- Executing programs and committing batches
- Participating in the FROST signing protocol
- Maintaining uptime and correct execution

See [Validators & Staking](/docs/vara-eth/economics/validators-staking) for details.

## Using wVARA

Once you have wVARA, the main uses are:

### Fund a Program

```typescript
// Approve program (Mirror address) to spend wVARA
const wvara = new ethers.Contract(wvaraAddress, erc20Abi, signer);
await wvara.approve(mirrorAddress, parseUnits("100", 18));

// Top up program's Executable Balance
const mirror = new ethers.Contract(mirrorAddress, mirrorAbi, signer);
await mirror.executableBalanceTopUp(parseUnits("100", 18));
```

### Send Message with ETH Value (Optional)

Message value on `sendMessage` is ETH (payable), not wVARA:

```typescript
const mirror = new ethers.Contract(mirrorAddress, mirrorAbi, signer);
await mirror.sendMessage(payload, false, {
  value: ethers.parseEther("0.01"),
});
```

### Stake as Validator

Lock wVARA to join the executor set and earn rewards. See [Validators & Staking](/docs/vara-eth/economics/validators-staking).

## Token Address

| Network | wVARA Address |
|---|---|
| Hoodi Testnet | See [Contract Addresses](/docs/vara-eth/reference/contract-addresses) |
| Ethereum Mainnet | Not yet deployed |

Add wVARA to MetaMask: Import the token address as a custom ERC-20 token. See [Wallet Setup](/docs/vara-eth/setup/wallet-setup) for instructions.
