# Wallet Setup

Vara.eth uses standard Ethereum wallets. If you have MetaMask, you're ready to go.

## Add Hoodi Network

The fastest way is to visit [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/chain/560048) and click "Add to MetaMask."

**Manual setup:**

1. Open MetaMask → Settings → Networks → Add Network
2. Fill in the current Hoodi values from [Networks](/docs/vara-eth/setup/networks)
3. Save

## Get Test ETH

You need test ETH on Hoodi to pay for L1 transaction fees (sending messages to Mirror contracts, creating programs).

Visit [eth.vara.network/testnet](https://eth.vara.network/testnet) and request test ETH. Tokens arrive within a few minutes.

<Callout type="note" title="Why ETH?">
  Even though Vara.eth uses the [reverse gas model](/docs/vara-eth/economics/reverse-gas-model) (programs pay for
  execution), you still need ETH for the base Ethereum transaction fee.
</Callout>

## Get Test wVARA

wVARA funds your program's [Executable Balance](/docs/vara-eth/interact/funding-executable-balance). Without wVARA, your program cannot execute messages.

Visit [eth.vara.network/testnet](https://eth.vara.network/testnet) to request test wVARA.

Once you have wVARA, fund your program via:

- `executableBalanceTopUp(value)` on the Mirror contract
- `ethexe` CLI
- TypeScript SDK

→ [wVARA Overview](/docs/vara-eth/economics/wvara-overview)

## Verify Your Setup

Quick checklist:

- MetaMask switched to Hoodi network
- ETH balance > 0
- wVARA balance > 0 (add token via [Contract Addresses](/docs/vara-eth/reference/contract-addresses))
- Your address visible on [Hoodi Etherscan](https://hoodi.etherscan.io)

## For CLI Users

If you prefer command-line workflows, insert your private key into `ethexe`:

```bash
ethexe key insert <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
  Only use test wallets with testnet keys. Never use your mainnet private key in development environments.
</Callout>
