# Pick Your Path

Choose the path that matches your goal. Each track is designed to get you productive quickly.

## Build Programs

**Write application logic in Rust, compile to WASM, deploy to Ethereum.**

Programs run off-chain in validator networks but maintain state on L1. You'll use the [Sails framework](/docs/developing/build/sails) and work with the [actor model](/docs/gear/actor-model).

→ Start: [Quick Start](/docs/vara-eth/build/quickstart) (5 minutes to first deploy)  
→ Full workflow: [Program Basics](/docs/vara-eth/build/program-basics) → [Testing](/docs/vara-eth/build/testing-debugging) → [Deploy](/docs/vara-eth/deploy/upload-validation)

**Need:** Basic Rust. No Solidity required.

## Integrate from Solidity

**Call Vara.eth programs from your existing Ethereum contracts.**

Offload heavy computation (order books, AI inference, complex game logic) while keeping your core contracts on L1.

→ Start: [Solidity Integration](/docs/vara-eth/integrate/solidity-integration)  
→ Patterns: [Choosing a Pattern](/docs/vara-eth/integrate/choosing-a-pattern)

**Need:** Solidity, Foundry or Hardhat.

## Integrate from Frontend

**Connect web apps to Vara.eth programs with TypeScript.**

Use typed clients generated from your program's IDL. Handle both Ethereum-side (wallet signatures) and Vara.eth-side (instant pre-confirmations) flows.

→ Start: [Frontend Integration](/docs/vara-eth/integrate/frontend-integration)  
→ Library docs: [Sails-JS](/docs/developing/sails-js) (typed clients, React hooks)

**Need:** JavaScript/TypeScript, basic web3 (ethers.js or viem).

## Integrate from Backend

**Build services that interact with Vara.eth programs.**

Run off-chain workers, automate program interactions, or build indexers. Use the same TypeScript SDK as frontends or call JSON-RPC directly.

→ Start: [Backend Integration](/docs/vara-eth/integrate/backend-integration)  
→ API reference: [RPC API](/docs/vara-eth/reference/rpc-api)

**Need:** Any language with HTTP client. TypeScript SDK available.

## Learn the System

**Understand how Vara.eth works: validators, settlement, economics.**

Read if you're evaluating Vara.eth for your project, contributing to the protocol, or building infrastructure.

**Recommended order:**

1. [What is Vara.eth?](/docs/vara-eth/start-here/what-is-vara-eth) — mental model
2. [Why It Matters](/docs/vara-eth/start-here/why-it-matters) — core innovations
3. [Vara.eth Whitepaper](https://eth.vara.network/whitepaper) — complete design
4. [Technical Documentation](https://eth.vara.network/whitepaper/vara.eth-technical.pdf) — implementation spec
5. [Deep Dives](/docs/vara-eth/start-here/deep-dives) — architecture details, source code

**Economics and operations:**

- [wVARA Overview](/docs/vara-eth/economics/wvara-overview) — token model
- [Reverse Gas](/docs/vara-eth/economics/reverse-gas-model) — programs pay, not users
- [Validators & Staking](/docs/vara-eth/economics/validators-staking) — how validation works

**Foundation:**

- [Actor Model](/docs/gear/actor-model) — execution model
- [Bridge Technical Overview](/docs/vara-network/bridge/bridge_technical) — cross-chain architecture
