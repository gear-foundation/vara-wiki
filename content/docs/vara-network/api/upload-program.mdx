title: Upload Program
---

A program compiled to Wasm can be uploaded to the Vara network. During uploading, it is initialized in the network to be able to send and receive messages with other actors in the network (programs and users).

Use `api.program.upload` method to create `upload_program` extrinsic

```javascript
const code = fs.readFileSync('path/to/program.wasm');

const program = {
  code,
  gasLimit: 1000000,
  value: 1000,
  initPayload: somePayload,
};

try {
  const { programId, codeId, salt, extrinsic } = api.program.upload(
    program,
    meta,
  );
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`${error.name}: ${error.message}`);
}

try {
  await extrinsic.signAndSend(keyring, (event) => {
    console.log(event.toHuman());
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`${error.name}: ${error.message}`);
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="Gas Calculation for Init">
    To calculate the gas required for processing an `init` message, use the following method:

    `api.program.calculateGas.initUpload()`

    For a deeper dive into the gas mechanics, see the [Calculate Gas](/docs/developing/api/calculate-gas) documentation.
