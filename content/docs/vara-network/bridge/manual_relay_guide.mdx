title: Manual Relay Guide
custom_title: Manual Message Bridging
---

import { eth, vara } from '@/addresses/bridge-addresses.js';

This guide describes how to manually push a message across the bridge between Vara network and Ethereum network if the **Relayer is unavailable**. All steps are illustrated for `USDT` token as an example, but the same process applies to any supported token or arbitrary cross-chain message.

<Callout type="info" title="Guaranteed Delivery">
    If the Relayer is unavailable, any bridging message remains safely **stored on-chain**.

    No message is lost—manual relaying can be used at any time to finalize the process and complete the delivery.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn" title="Verify Contract Addresses">
    **Crucial:** Always verify all contract addresses before initiating a bridge transaction.

    The addresses provided in this guide are for current test deployments. For both **Testnet** and **Mainnet**, you can find the most up-to-date official addresses in the [Vara Bridge Developer Hub](https://wiki.vara.network/docs/bridge/developer_hub).

## Bridging Ethereum → Vara

### 1. Approve Token Transfer

![Approve USDT for Bridging](/images/docs/bridge/approve.png)

- **Open** the <a href={`https://hoodi.etherscan.io/address/${eth.usdt}`}>test USDT contract on Hoodi Etherscan</a>.
- Go to **Contract → Write Contract** tab.
- Click **Connect to Web3** and select a wallet with sender’s account.
- Use the `approve` method:
  - **spender:** <code>{eth.erc20ManagerProxy}</code> (Erc20Manager Proxy address on Hoodi)
  - **value:** Amount to transfer (USDT uses 6 decimals, so `1 USDT = 1_000_000`, `5 USDT = 5_000_000`)

### 2. Initiate Bridging

![Request Bridging](/images/docs/bridge/request-bridging.png)

- **Open** <a href={`https://hoodi.etherscan.io/address/${eth.erc20ManagerProxy}#writeProxyContract`}>Erc20Manager Proxy contract on Hoodi Etherscan</a>.
- Go to **Contract → Write as Proxy**.
- Connect wallet if needed.
- Use the `requestBridging` method:
  - **token:** <code>{eth.usdt}</code> (USDT address)
  - **amount:** Same as above or less (≤ approved amount)
  - **to:** Recipient address on Vara (hex string, e.g., convert from SS58 on <a href="https://ss58.org">ss58.org</a>)
- **Send** the transaction.

At this point, Erc20Manager emits a `BridgingRequested` event.

### 3. Relay Event Data to Vara

The final step is to relay proof of the bridging event from Ethereum to the Vara network. This means providing evidence that the required Ethereum block was finalized and that a transaction containing the relevant event (`BridgingRequested`) was actually included and executed on-chain.

![Event hash USDT for Bridging](/images/docs/bridge/event_hash.png)

To do this:

- **Find the transaction hash** that emitted the `BridgingRequested` event.
- This is visible in the event list after submitting the bridging transaction.
- This hash serves as the unique reference to the on-chain proof and will be used by the relayer to gather and submit all necessary data from Ethereum to Vara.

Next, run the Gear Bridge Relayer Docker container, providing it with the transaction hash and other required parameters.

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/gear-tech/bridge-relayer:main.1037c949fb897aa855ec117830747e6fb16749c4
```

> Latest Docker images for the Gear Bridge Relayer are published at: [https://github.com/gear-tech/gear-bridges/pkgs/container/bridge-relayer](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear-bridges/pkgs/container/bridge-relayer)

```sh
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 \
ghcr.io/gear-tech/bridge-relayer:main.1037c949fb897aa855ec117830747e6fb16749c4 \
gear-eth-manual \
  --tx-hash <TX_HASH> \
  --checkpoint-light-client ${vara.checkpointLightClient} \
  --historical-proxy ${vara.historicalProxy} \
  --receiver-program ${vara.vftManager} \
  --ethereum-endpoint "wss://hoodi-reth-rpc.gear-tech.io/ws" \
  --ethereum-beacon-rpc https://hoodi-nimbus-rpc.gear-tech.io \
  --gear-domain wss://testnet.vara.network \
  --gear-port 443 \
  --gear-suri "<SUBSTRATE_MNEMONIC_PHRASE>"
```

Replace `<TX_HASH>` with your transaction hash.  
Replace `<SUBSTRATE_MNEMONIC_PHRASE>` with the **mnemonic phrase for the Vara account** that pays for network fees.

<Callout type="warn" title="Finalization is not Instant">
    After submitting the proof, the rewarding process requires waiting for the **Light Client** on Vara to synchronize.

    *   **Timing:** This usually takes **15–20 minutes** after the bridging transaction is mined on Ethereum.
    *   **Process:** The proof can only be submitted and verified on-chain once this synchronization is complete.
    *   **Result:** Transferred tokens will appear on Vara immediately after the cross-chain proof is accepted.

    *Please do not resubmit the transaction during this synchronization period.*
</Callout>


To confirm the result, check the state of the **wrapped USDT token program** on Vara using the `balanceOf` function.  
This can be done on <a href={`https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs/${vara.wusdt}?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-archive.vara.network`}>IDEA</a>:  
- Click "Read state"
- Select `balanceOf`
- Enter the recipient address

The updated balance will reflect the received tokens after successful bridging.

## Bridging Vara → Ethereum

The bridging procedure from Vara to Ethereum is **very similar** to the reverse direction described above.

The user interacts with the **VftManager program** on Vara. The bridging flow consists of the following main steps:

### 0. (Optional) Tokenize TVARA to VFT

If your tokens are not yet tokenized as VFT (Vara Fungible Tokens), you need to convert your TVARA using the `VftNativeExchange::Mint` message.  
This will mint the desired amount of VFT in <a href={`https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs/${vara.tokenizedVara}?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-archive.vara.network`}>TVARA token program</a>.

### 1. Approve VftManager to Spend Tokens

![Approve TVARA](/images/docs/bridge/vara-approve.png)

- Open the VFT token contract, e.g., <a href={`https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs/${vara.tokenizedVara}?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-archive.vara.network`}>TVARA token program</a>.
- Use the `approve` function:
  - **spender:** <code>{vara.vftManager}</code> (VftManager address)
  - **value:** Amount to transfer (TVARA uses 12 decimals, so `1 TVARA = 1_000_000_000_000`)

### 2. Request Bridging via VftManager

![Request TVARA Bridging](/images/docs/bridge/vara-request-bridging.png)

- Open the <a href={`https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs/${vara.vftManager}?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-archive.vara.network`}>VftManager program</a>
- Call the `RequestBridging` function:
  - **vara_token_id:** Address of the token contract (e.g., <code>{vara.tokenizedVara}</code>)
  - **amount:** Amount to bridge (must be ≤ approved value)
  - **receiver:** Ethereum recipient address (hex)

After successful execution of both the **approve** and **RequestBridging** steps,  
the VftManager program emits a `BridgingRequested` event containing a `nonce` and `block` number.

**How to find the event:**
- Go to the <a href={`https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs/${vara.vftManager}?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet-archive.vara.network`}>VftManager program</a>
- Switch to the **Events** tab to locate the relevant `BridgingRequested` event and copy the `nonce` and `block` values.

![Event TVARA](/images/docs/bridge/vara-bridging-request-event.png)

### 3. Relay Proof to Ethereum

Run the relayer Docker container with the `nonce` and `block` values from your `BridgingRequested` event.

```shell
docker run --rm -it --platform linux/amd64 \
ghcr.io/gear-tech/bridge-relayer:main.1037c949fb897aa855ec117830747e6fb16749c4 \
gear-eth-manual \
  --message-nonce "<NONCE>" \
  --message-block <BLOCK> \
  --from-eth-block <ETH_BLOCK> \
  --gear-domain wss://testnet-archive.vara.network \
  --gear-port 443 \
  --ethereum-endpoint "wss://hoodi-reth-rpc.gear-tech.io/ws" \
  --mq-address "${vara.messageQueueProxy}" \
  --eth-fee-payer "<ETH_PRIVATE_KEY>"
```

![how to get Ethereum block](/images/docs/bridge/eth-block.png)

- To get `<ETH_BLOCK>` go to [erc20 Manager Proxy contract](https://hoodi.etherscan.io/address/${eth.erc20ManagerProxy}#events), find your relevant bridging transaction, and note the Ethereum block number in which the event was emitted. Use this block number as the value for `--from-eth-block`.
- `<MQ_ADDRESS>`: This is the MQ (Message Queue Proxy) address used by the bridge. You can find it in the documentation or in the contract’s Read/Write panel on Etherscan.
- `<ETH_PRIVATE_KEY>`: Your Ethereum fee-payer private key.

<Callout type="warn" title="Key Security">
    The private key is used **only locally** for signing. The relayer does not transmit your sensitive data, but you should always handle private keys with extreme caution.
</Callout>

<Callout type="note" title="Transaction Finalization">
    Finalization and minting on Ethereum are **not instant**.

    After relaying, the message will be processed, and wrapped tokens (e.g., **WTVARA**) will appear in the recipient's balance once the network confirms the transaction.

    **To verify the result:**
    1. Open the [WTVARA Contract](https://etherscan.io) (or your specific token) on **Etherscan**.
    2. Navigate to the **Read Contract** tab.
    3. Call the `balanceOf` function using the recipient's address.
</Callout>
