## What Is Vara Fungible Token (VFT)?

Vara Fungible Token (VFT) is the Vara network's equivalent of Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. You can find detailed specifications [above](/docs/vara-network/examples/Standards/vft).

For use with the [Vara↔Ethereum Bridge](/docs/vara-network/bridge), an extended version of the VFT standard is utilized, which includes additional methods beyond the base spec.

This guide shows you how to launch a fungible token on the Vara network from the pre-compiled code while **preserving your ownership and admin rights** over it.

## How to Upload the VFT to Vara

### Prerequisites

1. A Vara [account](/docs/vara-network/account) using any Substrate-compatible wallet (e.g., SubWallet, Polkadot.js extension).
2. A small amount of VARA tokens to pay gas fees on the **Vara Mainnet**.  
3. On the **Vara Testnet**, you can get free TVARA from the [Gear IDEA testnet](https://idea.gear-tech.io/programs?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet.vara.network):  
   - Click the **Balance** button (top-right).  
   - Then click **Get Test Balance**.

### Uploading the VFT Program

To simplify the process, the VFT code is already deployed to the network. You just need to instantiate a program from it.

1. Open the VFT Code Page: [VFT Code on IDEA Platform](https://idea.gear-tech.io/code/0xef6542427824b4a3560a9a1906344d438adeb38336606922116c64f9da65a830?node=wss%3A%2F%2Ftestnet.vara.network)  
2. Scroll down and click **Create Program**.  
3. Fill in the required parameters (see example on the page):

4. Click **Calculate** (gas) and then **Submit**.  
5. Sign the transaction in your wallet—your fungible token is now live on the Vara network!

### Finalizing Setup for Bridge Compatibility

To ensure compatibility with the bridge and other tools, you must send two additional messages to the program:

**First message:**
1. Click **Send Message**  
2. **Service**: `VftExtension`  
3. **Function**: `AllocateNextBalancesShard`  
4. Click **Calculate**, then **Send Message**  
5. Sign the transaction

**Second message:**
1. Click **Send Message** again  
2. **Service**: `VftExtension`  
3. **Function**: `AllocateNextAllowancesShard`  
4. Click **Calculate**, then **Send Message**  
5. Sign the transaction

## What's Next?

* Your deployed token will appear in the **Programs** tab.  
* It can also be accessed directly via its on-chain address (e.g., 0x2291a95a56293a51227ff2f18931d5439175cf98adc7cdbef24110d4e88d998b).  
* To inspect its current state, go to **Read State**, select the appropriate **Service** and **Query** function.

## Admin Capabilities

As the creator (admin), you can now send privileged messages to the contract to:

* Mint or burn tokens  
* Add or remove other admins  
* Assign user roles or permissions  
* Configure token parameters
* Intergrate to your application

This gives you full control to manage the token as needed.
