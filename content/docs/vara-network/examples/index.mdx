title: Program Examples
---

This section contains a set of examples that can be used for familiarization with writing programs on Vara or as the basis for dApps: [https://github.com/gear-foundation](https://github.com/gear-foundation).

Programs can be written from scratch or built from provided examples.

## Stable Environment

All program examples and JS applications have been tested in a stable environment with specific development tool versions necessary for implementing, building, and running programs and JS applications.

[//]: # (A local development environment can be configured according to the information provided below or by using a pre-configured Docker image as described in the [Using Docker]&#40;#using-docker&#41; section.)

The **latest releases** of Gear librarires are avaible in the **[GitHub](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/releases)**.

<Callout type="warn" title="Windows Compatibility">
    Windows users often encounter issues with Rust dependencies. We **strongly recommend** using Linux or macOS for compiling Vara nodes and programs.

    **Tip:** If you are on Windows, using **WSL2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is the best way to ensure a stable development environment.

## First Steps

- Create a new project (named, for example - `vara-app`) by running:

    ```bash
    cargo sails program vara-app
    ```

  Your `vara-app` directory tree should look like this

      ```
      vara-app
      │
      ├── app
      │   └── src
      │       └── lib.rs
      │
      ├── client
      │   └── ...
      │
      ├── src
      │   └── lib.rs     
      │
      ├── tests
      │   └── gtest.rs
      │
      ├── build.rs
      │
      ├── Cargo.toml
      │
      └──  README.md
      ```


  `Cargo.toml` file is a project manifest in Rust. The essential libraries required for compiling a project are automatically included there.

- Write your program's code

- Compile the Wasm program in the app folder:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
