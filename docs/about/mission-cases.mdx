## Vara mission

Vara provides environment for developers to build decentralized applications, at a new level in the Web3 industry. Anyone can instantiate a program that becomes a part of the network. 
Built as a WebAssembly native blockchain, any developer has the ability to write and compile in traditional languages. 

By bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3 for developers, Vara opens up opportunities for the next generation of decentralized applications, helping speed up adoption and spearheading the future of Web3 technologies.

In addition, Vara Network offers low transaction costs, gas fee rebates, staking, participation in governance, validator, nominator and ambassador programs.

## Use cases

Vara's strengths in providing scalability and security allow it to support next-gen Gaming and Financial-based applications. However Vara is capable of working with a vast number of different business and application use cases including tokenizing real world assets, supply chain management, and storing verifiable documentation such as academic results and digital identities. These next generation solutions require low latency execution and high level memory management, which Vara provides, enabling it to act as the fastest and most reliable on-ramp for the next iteration of applications.

### On-chain gaming

The gaming industry is the largest and fast growing entertainment business. It is larger than the movie and music industries combined.

During the gaming process, players create, buy or exchange digital gaming assets. Blockchain technology perfectly fits in to carry out in-game transactions and confirm the assets ownership and possession. It enables new game mechanics and economic models (like the play-to-earn). Smart contracts take advantage of blockchain technology's security and transparency guarantees to ensure protection of in-game assets represented by NFTs.

Game creators have realized the benefits of this technology and increasingly use it as one of the essential parts of their game architecture. Since transactions in Gear are very fast and cheap, it fits perfectly for highly loaded gaming applications with a huge number of transactions.

### Financial-based applications

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a blockchain-based alternative to the current financial system. DeFi applications let you borrow, save, invest, trade, exchange and do much more with your money than traditional financial systems allow. Whereas the current financial system is opaque, tightly controlled and outdated, DeFi empowers individuals by giving them personal control and visibility over their finances. This new financial market, which has fewer intermediaries, can potentially be very beneficial for its users.

Thanks to the Gear's architecture, scalability and technology features, transactions on a Gear Network are processed at an enormous speed and as a result, have an insignificant fee. It makes launching smart contracts on a Vara Network especially attractive for DeFi scenarios.
