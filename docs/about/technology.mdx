Vara benefits from Gear's unique tech stack that includes the Actor Model, Persistent Memory and the WebAssembly virtual machine (Wasm). 
More details can be found on **[Gear wiki](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/docs/)**.

## Actor Model

Anyone can instantiate a program that becomes a part of the network. In the Actor Model for communications these programs as well as users are known as “actors”. Actors do not share their state and communicate via messages, this way adding an extra layer of security to the network. All communications are asynchronous, but logically guaranteed to be handled, which increases the achievable network  speed and allows building of more sophisticated dApps.

## Persistent Memory

The Persistent Memory concept implies that programs don't use shared storage, but rather their full state is persisted in individual memory space. Clever and effective memory virtualization techniques allow tracking memory access and ensuring that only required pages are persisted and loaded when needed. It removes many complexities smoothing the development process, while also mapping running programs and their states to more closely resemble real-life operating system primitives.

## Wasm

WebAssembly allows the running of any bytecode in a sandboxed environment. Smart contracts in Vara are run as Wasm programs (Actors), and since Wasm can be compiled from a variety of common programming languages, it considerably lowers the barrier to entry for developers arriving from the Web2 space. 
Enabling native speed for deterministic cross-platforms computations, Wasm is Web3 development unlocked.
