The Gear Protocol is a Substrate-based smart-contract platform that enables anyone to develop and run a dApp in a matter of minutes. The Gear Protocol is the most developer-friendly way to implement smart contracts with arbitrary logic and of any complexity. 

Vara benefits from Gear Protocol's unique tech stack that includes the Actor Model, Persistent Memory and the WebAssembly virtual machine (Wasm). 
More details can be found on **[Gear Wiki](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/docs/)**.

## Actor Model

In the Actor Model for communications these programs as well as users are known as “actors”. Actors do not share their state and communicate via messages, this way adding an extra layer of security to the network. All communications are asynchronous, but logically guaranteed to be handled, which increases the achievable network speed and allows building of more sophisticated dApps.

## Persistent Memory

The Persistent Memory concept implies that programs don't use shared storage, but rather their full state is persisted in individual memory space. Clever and effective memory virtualization techniques allow tracking memory access and ensuring that only required pages are persisted and loaded when needed. It removes many complexities smoothing the development process, while also mapping running programs and their states to more closely resemble real-life operating system primitives.

## Wasm

WebAssembly allows the running of any bytecode in a sandboxed environment. Smart contracts in Vara are run as Wasm programs (Actors), and since Wasm can be compiled from a variety of common programming languages, it considerably lowers the barrier to entry for developers arriving from the Web2 space. 
Enabling native speed for deterministic cross-platforms computations, Wasm is Web3 development unlocked.

## Network Upgrade

As any software system, blockchains tend to update with security patches or other changes in the code. First blockchains had to create a fork in order to update. Each fork causes lack of stability as well as price volatility. It is difficult to coordinate updates that should be agreed by the whole community in the decentralized system.

Since Vara is based on the Substrate blockchain development framework, it supports forkless runtime upgrades. Substrate makes it possible to deploy enhanced runtime capabilities (including breaking changes) without a hard fork. Because the definition of the runtime is itself an element in a Substrate chain's state, network participants may update this value by way of an extrinsic.
