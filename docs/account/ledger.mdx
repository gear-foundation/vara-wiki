# Ledger Hardware Wallet Integration with Vara Network

Hardware wallets, also known as cold wallets, are physical devices designed to securely store private keys offline, safeguarding your funds from unauthorized access and cyber threats. **Ledger** is one of the world’s leading hardware wallet providers, trusted globally for robust security and ease of use.

**Vara Network** supports Ledger hardware wallets through the **Polkadot application**, as Vara does not currently have its own dedicated Ledger app. By connecting Ledger devices with **NovaWallet** or **SubWallet**, you can securely store **VARA tokens**, make transactions, and engage in staking and governance activities.

## Supported Ledger Wallet Models

- Ledger Nano S Plus
- Ledger Nano X
- Ledger Stax
- Ledger Flex

**Key Note:** Always verify compatibility and supported devices via the 
<a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Ledger website</a>.

## Requirements

To use Ledger with **Vara Network**, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- **Initialized Ledger Device**  (<a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113-Set-up-your-Ledger-Nano-X-or-Nano-S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Setup</a>).

## Connecting Ledger via the Polkadot App

Ledger allows integration with the Vara Network through the official **Polkadot app**.

### Steps to connect:

1. Open **Ledger Live** and go to **"My Ledger"**.
2. Connect and unlock your **Ledger device**.
3. Search for and install the **Polkadot application**.

:::info
The Polkadot address you create is a **universal Substrate-based address**, meaning you can receive and manage **VARA tokens** directly using this account.
