# X402 Protocol

Vara Network supports the [X402 payment protocol](https://www.x402.org/), enabling developers to build monetizable APIs and services with seamless micropayments.

## Overview

X402 is an open standard for HTTP-based payments developed by Coinbase. It uses the HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status code to enable pay-per-request API access, content paywalls, and agentic commerce.

When a client requests a paid resource, the server responds with a 402 status and payment details. The client then includes payment information via the `X-PAYMENT` header in subsequent requests.

## Key Features

- **Native token support** — accepts both VARA and VFT (Vara Fungible Tokens)
- **Framework integrations** — ready-to-use middleware for Express.js, Next.js, and Axios interceptors
- **Low-cost micropayments** — Vara's sub-second block times and minimal fees make per-request payments practical
- **Protocol compliance** — full compatibility with the X402 specification

## How It Works

1. Client requests a resource from a server
2. Server responds with `402 Payment Required` and payment instructions
3. Client prepares and submits a payment payload
4. Server verifies payment via the x402 facilitator's `/verify` and `/settle` endpoints
5. Upon successful verification, server provides the requested resource

The facilitator handles payment verification and on-chain settlement, so developers don't need direct blockchain infrastructure.

## Use Cases

- **API monetization** — charge per request for AI/ML inference, data feeds, oracles, or computational services
- **Content paywalls** — direct payments to content creators without intermediaries
- **Agentic commerce** — enable AI agents to pay for API calls, data queries, and services autonomously
