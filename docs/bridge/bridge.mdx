# Vara Bridge

:::important
The Vara Bridge is now live for testing between the Vara Testnet and the Ethereum Holesky Testnet. You can try it out [here](https://zk-bridge-stg.vara.network/).
For updates on the upcoming Vara Bridge mainnet launch, follow [Vara Network on X](https://x.com/VaraNetwork) or check out the [Vara Blog](https://vara.network/news).

## Introduction
**Vara Bridge** is a trustless, ZK-based cross-chain bridge designed to transfer tokens and data securely between Ethereum and the Vara Network. It leverages **Plonky2** circuits and zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) to validate transactions without revealing sensitive information. By doing so, Vara Bridge minimizes the risk of manipulation or fraud while delivering efficient cross-chain transfers. 

In short, the bridge unites **Ethereum’s** liquidity and established ecosystem with **Vara Network’s** speed and scalability. This integration expands token liquidity, enables new utilities, and facilitates cross-chain interactions for **VARA** and other tokens deployed on Vara.

## Supported Tokens
We're actively working to add more assets to the bridge, so expect the list of supported tokens to grow in the near future.

- **VARA** ([wVARA](https://holesky.etherscan.io/token/0x1ebbdad5274735fd2651d872a25abb19d6b025f0) on Ethereum Holesky)  
- **ETH**

## Key Benefits of Vara Bridge

### For the VARA Token
By enabling **wrapped VARA (wVARA)** on Ethereum, the bridge introduces a critical avenue for growth and utility:

- **Enhanced Liquidity**  
  - Listing wVARA on popular Ethereum DEX platforms (e.g., Uniswap, Balancer, SushiSwap, HyperLiquid).  
  - Potential listings on centralized exchanges that support Ethereum-based assets.  
  - Broader exposure to Ethereum’s DeFi infrastructure.

- **New Utility**  
  - **Staking/Restaking:** Users can stake or restake wVARA (e.g., in Symbiotic) to earn rewards while helping secure Gear.exe computations.  
  - **Operator Rewards:** Node operators running Gear.exe gain additional incentives, creating a more robust and high-performance network.

Ultimately, bridging VARA to Ethereum expands the token’s financial flexibility, market visibility, and collaborative opportunities.

### For Projects on Vara
Projects and dApps built on Vara benefit significantly from tapping into Ethereum’s user base and liquidity:

- **Access to New Users and Capital**  
  - Instantly reach Ethereum’s extensive DeFi ecosystem, liquidity pools, and yield-farming platforms.

- **Cross-Chain Opportunities**  
  - Deploy dApps that communicate seamlessly between Vara and Ethereum (e.g., Invariant, Guardian Protocol, VarSwap).  
  - Create Vara-based tokens that can also be listed or traded on Ethereum DEXs.

- **Simplified Token Listings**  
  - Project tokens originating on Vara can leverage top-tier Ethereum DEXs and existing tooling with minimal friction.  

By bridging to Ethereum, Vara-based projects gain broader user engagement, increased capital flow, and enhanced cross-chain functionality.
