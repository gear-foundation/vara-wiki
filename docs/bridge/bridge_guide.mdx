The Vara Bridge is currently in public test mode between the Vara Testnet and Ethereum’s Holesky Testnet. Stay updated on the mainnet launch by following [Vara Network on X](https://x.com/VaraNetwork) or visiting the [Vara Blog](https://vara.network/news).

[**EitherWay**](https://zk-bridge-stg.vara.network/) – the officially supported bridge interface designed for asset transfers between Ethereum and Vara.

**EitherWay** currently supports transfers for the following assets:

- **VARA (Vara Native) ↔ wVARA** (on Ethereum) 
- **ETH (Ethereum Native) ↔ wETH** (on Vara)
- **USDT (on Ethereum) ↔ wUSDT** (on Vara)  
- **USDC (on Ethereum) ↔ wUSDC** (on Vara) 

You can access the official EitherWay interface [here](https://zk-bridge-stg.vara.network/)
