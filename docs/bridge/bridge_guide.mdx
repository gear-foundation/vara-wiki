One of the primary (but not single) implementations of the Vara-Ethereum Bridge is **EitherWay** – the officially supported bridge interface designed for asset transfers between Ethereum and Vara.

**EitherWay** currently supports transfers for the following assets:

- **VARA ↔ wVARA** (on Ethereum)  
- **USDC (Ethereum) ↔ wUSDC** (on Vara)  
- **ETH (Ethereum) ↔ Wrapped ETH (wETH)** (on Vara)

You can access the official EitherWay interface [here](https://www.varabridge.tech/)

## Quick Guide: Bridging Assets via EitherWay

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

**From Vara → Ethereum**  
Connect your Vara wallet by choosing from [supported wallets](https://vara.network/ecosystem?tags=6382654c-162d-4ed7-9215-b9504b60e72c).

**From Ethereum → Vara**  
Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)).

### Step 2: Select Asset & Amount

- Pick the asset you want to transfer (**VARA**, **USDC**, **ETH**).
- Specify the **exact amount** you want to bridge.

---

### Step 3: Enter Destination Address

- Provide the **receiving wallet address** on the **target network**.

---

### Step 4: Confirm and Initiate Swap

- Carefully **review transaction details**.
- Click the **“Swap”** button to begin bridging.
- Approve and **sign the transaction** in your wallet.

### Step 5: Track Your Transaction

Transfers usually complete within **~20 minutes**.

### Who Pays the Transfer Fees?

- **Vara → Ethereum**: You only need **VARA** tokens to pay the fee. *(No ETH required.)*  
- **Ethereum → Vara**: You need **ETH** to pay the fee, **plus** the asset you’re bridging.
