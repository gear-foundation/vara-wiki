:::note
The Vara Bridge is currently in public test mode between the Vara Testnet and Ethereum’s Holesky Testnet. Stay updated on the mainnet launch by following [Vara Network on X](https://x.com/VaraNetwork) or visiting the [Vara Blog](https://vara.network/news).
:::

[**EitherWay**](https://bridge.vara.network/) – the officially supported bridge interface designed for asset transfers between Vara and Ethereum. It currently supports transfers for the following assets:

- **VARA (Vara Native) ↔ wVARA** (on Ethereum) 
- **ETH (Ethereum Native) ↔ wETH** (on Vara)
- **USDT (on Ethereum) ↔ wUSDT** (on Vara)  
- **USDC (on Ethereum) ↔ wUSDC** (on Vara)

## Quick Guide: Bridging Assets via EitherWay

### Wallet Requirements

**From Vara → Ethereum**
Connect your Vara wallet by selecting one of [the supported wallets](https://vara.network/ecosystem?tags=6382654c-162d-4ed7-9215-b9504b60e72c).

**From Ethereum → Vara**
Connect your Ethereum-compatible wallet (e.g., [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) etc)

---

### Step 1: Select Asset & Amount

- Pick the asset you want to transfer (**VARA**, **USDC**, **USDT** or **ETH**).
- Specify the **exact amount** you want to bridge.

---

### Step 2: Enter Destination Address

- Provide the **receiving wallet address** on the **target network**.

---

### Step 3: Confirm and Initiate Swap

- If your wallet is not already connected, click **Connect Wallet**
- Click **Transfer** to start the process  
- Review the **transaction details**
- Approve and **sign the transaction** 

---

### Step 4: Track Your Transaction

The **Transactions** tab lets you check the status of current and past transfers without leaving the interface.

Transfers usually complete within **~30 minutes**.

---

### Step 5: Claim Native VARA (if bridging from Ethereum)

If you bridged **wVARA** from Ethereum back to Vara, the tokens will first arrive in your account as VFT tokens managed by the bridge.

To convert them into native VARA, you’ll need to **unlock** them manually:

- Go to the “My Tokens” tab
- Make sure your **Substrate wallet is connected**
- Click **Unlock** next to your VFT token balance

:::note
### Who Pays the Transfer Fees?

- **Vara → Ethereum**: You only need **VARA** tokens to pay the fee. *(No ETH required.)*  
- **Ethereum → Vara**: You need **ETH** to pay the fee, **regardless** of the asset you’re bridging.
