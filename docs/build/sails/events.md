# Events

Sails offers a mechanism to emit events from your service while processing commands.
These events serve as a means to notify off-chain subscribers about changes in
the application state. 

In Sails, events are configured and emitted on a per-service
basis through the `events` argument of the `#[gservice]` attribute. They are defined
by a Rust enum, with each variant representing a separate event and its optional data.
Once a service declares that it emits events, the `#[gservice]` attribute automatically
generates the `notify_on` service method. This method can be called by the service
to emit an event. For example:

```rust
fn counter_mut() -> &'static mut u32 {
    static mut COUNTER: u32 = 0;
    unsafe { &mut COUNTER }
}

struct MyCounter;

#[derive(Encode, TypeInfo)]
enum MyCounterEvent {
    Incremented(u32),
}

#[gservice(events = MyCounterEvent)]
impl MyCounter {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self
    }

    pub fn increment(&mut self) {
        *counter_mut() += 1;
        self.notify_on(MyCounterEvent::Incremented(*counter_mut())).unwrap();
    }

    // This method is generated by the `#[gservice]` attribute
    fn notify_on(&mut self, event: MyCounterEvent) -> Result<()> {
        ...
    }
}
```

It's important to note that, internally, events use the same mechanism as any other
message transmission in the Gear Protocol. This means an event is only published
upon the successful completion of the command that emitted it.
