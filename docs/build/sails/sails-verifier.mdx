# Sails Verifier

Sails Verifier is a tool that verifies whether a compiled program matches the required versions of `Sails`, `Rust`, and system dependencies. This ensures compatibility with the Vara network and guarantees predictable behavior during execution.

`Sails programs` must be compiled in a very specific environment. Even a small difference in Rust version, dependencies, or build flags can lead to different binary output â€” and different behavior.

Sails Verifier helps to:

	- âœ… Ensure your program was built in the correct environment
	- âœ… Guarantee determinism: same code = same binary = same behavior
	- âœ… Speed up audits and integration with other tools

## How to use it

If youâ€™re building on `Sails` â€” Sails Verifier should be part of your standard workflow. It helps you build safer, more reliable applications that everyone can trust.

First, compile your program using the official Docker image:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/app --entrypoint /bin/bash ghcr.io/gear-tech/sails-program-builder:<version> -c 'cargo build --release'
```

ðŸ‘‰ Browse available Docker image versions here:

Then, upload your binary and source code for verification using:
