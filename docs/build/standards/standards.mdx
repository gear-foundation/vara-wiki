# Vara Smart Contract Standards 

Smart contract standards define a unified set of rules and interfaces that ensure consistency and interoperability across the Vara Network ecosystem. By following these standards, developers create tokens and applications that work seamlessly with wallets, exchanges, dApps, and other platforms without requiring custom integrations.

## Why Standards Matter

Standards provide several key benefits:

- **Interoperability** - Tokens built on standards are automatically compatible with any application that supports the standard
- **User Experience** - Wallets can display tokens natively without additional integration work
- **Development Speed** - Developers can build on proven, tested implementations rather than starting from scratch
- **Ecosystem Growth** - Shared standards enable composability between different applications and services

## Who Can Use Vara Standards

Vara standards are designed for developers building decentralized applications on the Vara Network. Whether you're creating:

- [**Fungible tokens**](vft.md) for payments or rewards
- [**NFT collections**](vnft.md) for digital art or gaming assets
- [**Multi-token**](vmt.md) systems for complex applications

These standards provide the foundation you need.

## How to Use Standards

Each Vara standard is implemented using the [Sails](../../build/sails/sails.mdx) framework and available as a base service on [GitHub](https://github.com/gear-foundation/standards). Rather than complete applications, these services serve as foundational building blocks that you can extend and customize with your own business logic, access controls, and additional features.
