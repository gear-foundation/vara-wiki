# Extended Vara Fungible Token

This article is dedicated to the extension of the VFT standard as discussed in the paper [Vara fungible tokens - VFT](vft.md). Specifically, it will implement the mint and burn functionalities. However, this example should be considered as an illustrative implementation, as extensions to the standard may take various forms.

For a more detailed implementation, the code related to this article can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/gear-foundation/standards/tree/master/extended-vft).

## Possible additional features

```
    Mint(to, value)
    Burn(from, value)
    GrantAdminRole(to)
    GrantBurnerRole(to)
    GrantMinterRole(to)
    RevokeAdminRole(from)
    RevokeBurnerRole(from)
    RevokeMinterRole(from)
    Admins()
    Burners()
    Minters()
```

## Possible additional events

```
    Minted(to, value)
    Burned(from, value)
```

## Implementation details

To extend the functionality, it is necessary to add the existing VFT standard in the `Cargo.toml` file

```toml
vft-service = { git = "https://github.com/gear-foundation/standards" }
```

After adding the necessary dependency to `Cargo.toml`, a new service can be created in the extended version that includes the old one

```rust
use vft_service::Service as VftService;

pub struct ExtendedService {
    vft: VftService,
}
```

In order to extend the functionality it is necessary to use the extends argument in the `#[service]` attribute, *ExtendedService* then inherits the methods and properties of *VftService*. This means that all functionality provided by the *VftService* will now be available in the *ExtendedService*.

```rust
#[service(extends = VftService, events = Event)]
impl ExtendedService {
    // Realization of new functionality
}
```

The `events = Event` part indicates that *ExtendedService* will handle events specified in the `Event` structure. These events can be emitted during the execution of the serviceâ€™s methods.

```rust
pub enum Event {
    Minted { to: ActorId, value: U256 },
    Burned { from: ActorId, value: U256 },
}
```

Overall, the implementation of new methods in the extended version takes the following form:

```rust
#[service(extends = VftService, events = Event)]
impl ExtendedService {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            vft: VftService::new(),
        }
    }
    pub fn mint(&mut self, to: ActorId, value: U256) -> bool {
        if !self.get().minters.contains(&msg::source()) {
            panic!("Not allowed to mint")
        };

        let mutated = services::utils::panicking(|| {
            funcs::mint(Storage::balances(), Storage::total_supply(), to, value)
        });
        if mutated {
            let _ = self.notify_on(Event::Minted { to, value });
        }
        mutated
    }

    pub fn burn(&mut self, from: ActorId, value: U256) -> bool {
        if !self.get().burners.contains(&msg::source()) {
            panic!("Not allowed to burn")
        };

        let mutated = services::utils::panicking(|| {
            funcs::burn(Storage::balances(), Storage::total_supply(), from, value)
        });
        if mutated {
            let _ = self.notify_on(Event::Burned { from, value });
        }
        mutated
    }

    pub fn grant_admin_role(&mut self, to: ActorId) {
        self.ensure_is_admin();
        self.get_mut().admins.insert(to);
    }
    pub fn grant_minter_role(&mut self, to: ActorId) {
        self.ensure_is_admin();
        self.get_mut().minters.insert(to);
    }
    pub fn grant_burner_role(&mut self, to: ActorId) {
        self.ensure_is_admin();
        self.get_mut().burners.insert(to);
    }

    pub fn revoke_admin_role(&mut self, from: ActorId) {
        self.ensure_is_admin();
        self.get_mut().admins.remove(&from);
    }
    pub fn revoke_minter_role(&mut self, from: ActorId) {
        self.ensure_is_admin();
        self.get_mut().minters.remove(&from);
    }
    pub fn revoke_burner_role(&mut self, from: ActorId) {
        self.ensure_is_admin();
        self.get_mut().burners.remove(&from);
    }
    pub fn minters(&self) -> Vec<ActorId> {
        self.get().minters.clone().into_iter().collect()
    }

    pub fn burners(&self) -> Vec<ActorId> {
        self.get().burners.clone().into_iter().collect()
    }

    pub fn admins(&self) -> Vec<ActorId> {
        self.get().admins.clone().into_iter().collect()
    }
}
```

## Key methods

### `Mint`

```rust
pub fn mint(&mut self, to: ActorId, value: U256) -> bool
```

Mints new tokens and assigns them to the specified actor (to). It first checks if the caller has the minter role. If the minting is successful, it triggers a `Minted` event.

### `Burn`

```rust
pub fn burn(&mut self, from: ActorId, value: U256) -> bool
```

Burns tokens from the specified actor (from). It checks if the caller has the burner role. If the burning is successful, it triggers a `Burned` event.

### `Grant admin role`

```rust
pub fn grant_admin_role(&mut self, to: ActorId)
```

Grants the admin role to the specified actor (to). This function can only be called by an existing admin.

### `Grant minter role`

```rust
pub fn grant_minter_role(&mut self, to: ActorId)
```

Grants the minter role to the specified actor (to). This function can only be called by an existing admin.

### `Grant burner role`

```rust
pub fn grant_burner_role(&mut self, to: ActorId)
```

Grants the burner role to the specified actor (to). This function can only be called by an existing admin.

### `Revoke admin role`

```rust
pub fn revoke_admin_role(&mut self, from: ActorId)
```

Revokes the admin role from the specified actor (from). This function can only be called by an existing admin.

### `Revoke minter role`

```rust
pub fn revoke_minter_role(&mut self, from: ActorId)
```

Revokes the minter role from the specified actor (from). This function can only be called by an existing admin.

### `Revoke burner role`

```rust
pub fn revoke_burner_role(&mut self, from: ActorId)
```

Revokes the burner role from the specified actor (from). This function can only be called by an existing admin.


## Query methods

### `minters`

Returns a list of all actors who have the minter role.

```rust
pub fn minters(&self) -> Vec<ActorId> 
```

### `burners`

Returns a list of all actors who have the burner role.

```rust
pub fn burners(&self) -> Vec<ActorId> 
```

### `admins`

Returns a list of all actors who have the admin role.

```rust
pub fn admins(&self) -> Vec<ActorId> 
```

  query Decimals : () -> u8;
  query Name : () -> str;
  query Symbol : () -> str;
  query TotalSupply : () -> u256;

  events {
    Minted: struct { to: actor_id, value: u256 };
    Burned: struct { from: actor_id, value: u256 };
    Approval: struct { owner: actor_id, spender: actor_id, value: u256 };
    Transfer: struct { from: actor_id, to: actor_id, value: u256 };
  }
};
```
