# Archive of Program Examples

This folder contains examples of programs and use cases that may include outdated or no longer maintained code. These examples were created during the early stages of Gear Protocol's development. 

However, the use cases themselves remain relevant and can be implemented and deployed on the Vara network. 

The source code for these examples is still available on GitHub and can serve as a valuable resource for understanding how to develop using the low-level [`gstd`](/docs/build/gstd/) library. Anyone can try compiling and deploying them to testnet or mainnet to see how they function.
