# Vara Examples

This section contains a set of examples that can be used for familiarization with writing programs on Vara or as the basis for dApps: [https://github.com/gear-foundation](https://github.com/gear-foundation).

Programs can be written from scratch or built from provided examples.

## Stable Environment

All program examples and JS applications have been tested in a stable environment with specific development tool versions necessary for implementing, building, and running programs and JS applications.

<!--
A local development environment can be configured according to the information provided below or by using a pre-configured Docker image as described in the [Using Docker](#using-docker) section.
-->

The **latest releases** of Gear librarires are avaible in the **[GitHub](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear/releases)**.

:::warning Note
Windows users may encounter problems related to the installation of Rust components and dependencies.
It is highly recommended to use Linux or macOS for compiling Vara nodes and programs.

## First Steps

- Create a new project (named, for example - `vara-app`) by running:

    ```bash
    cargo sails new-program vara-app
    ```

  Your `vara-app` directory tree should look like this

      ```
      vara-app
      │
      ├── app
      │   └── src
      │       └── lib.rs
      │
      ├── client
      │   └── ...
      │
      ├── src
      │   └── lib.rs     
      │
      ├── tests
      │   └── gtest.rs
      │
      ├── build.rs
      │
      ├── Cargo.toml
      │
      └──  README.md
      ```


  `Cargo.toml` file is a project manifest in Rust. The essential libraries required for compiling a project are automatically included there.

- Write your program's code

- Compile the Wasm program in the app folder:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

Refer to [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started-in-5-minutes.md) for additional details.

## Using Docker

A pre-configured Docker image can be used to build and test programs. The image contains all necessary tools and dependencies for building and running programs and JS applications.

The source code of the image is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gear-foundation/gear-env).

To use the image, install Docker on the machine. Installation instructions for different operating systems are available on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

After installing Docker, pull the image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/gear-foundation/gear-env:stable
```

Run the image with the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm --name gear-env -itd ghcr.io/gear-foundation/gear-env:stable bash
```

The command will run the image in the background and provide access to the container's shell. Access the container's shell with:

```bash
docker exec -it gear-env bash
```

Copy a program to be built to the container (use the `gear-app` created above):

```bash
docker cp ./gear-app gear-env:/root
```

Build the program:

```bash
docker exec -itw /root/gear-app gear-env cargo build --release
```

The compiled program will be available in the `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` folder inside the container. Copy it to the local machine:

```bash
docker cp gear-env:/root/gear-app/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/. ./
```

Stop the Docker container after use:

```shell
docker stop gear-env
```
