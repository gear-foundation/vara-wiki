The Vara Network is substrate-based, which means that any keypair compatible with the standards of the `subkey` module will also work on Vara.

For most users, the use of popular and reliable wallets will be enough.
If you need to create a cold wallet for storing funds, then you should pay attention to Parity Signer (in the future we will also add Lager support)

### Storing your key safely

Your seed phrase is the key to your account. If you lose access to your account, by changing the device, forgetting the password, or losing the JSON file, you can restore your account by using the seed. This also means that someone else can have access to your account if they also have access to your seed.

We recommend that you store your seed in secure places like encrypted hard drives, non-digital devices or ideally, paper. We also recommend that you take other safety precautions to prevent this copy from physical damage, for example fire and water, and make multiple copies stored in different locations.

You should never store your seed on a device that is, or ever will be, connected to the internet.

### Storing your accounts JSON file

Your account’s JSON file is encrypted with a password. This means that while you can import into any wallet, you will need to use the password to do so successfully. As there is this additional layer of security - a password - you don’t have to be as cautious about securing it. However, it’s worth using highly secure passwords that are not used for anything else. It would be best if you made a note of this password offline.

## Via Polkadot.js browser extension

1. You can install the extension via the following links.

Install on [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd?hl=en)-based browser.

Install on [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension).

![img alt](./img/create-account-3.png)

:::note
The password that you choose here will be used to encrypt this account's information. You will need to re-enter it when attempting to process any kind of outgoing transaction, or when using it to cryptographically sign a message. This password is stored locally on the browser extension.

You've now successfully created a new account using the polkadot.js browser extension.
