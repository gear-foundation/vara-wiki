## Prerequisites

1. Linux users should generally install `GCC` and `Clang` according to their distribution’s documentation.

    For example, on Ubuntu use:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y build-essential clang cmake curl
    ```

    On macOS, you can get a compiler toolset by running:

    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```

2. Make sure you have installed all the tools required to build a program in Rust. [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) will be used to get Rust compiler ready:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

3. A Wasm compiler is necessary for compiling a Rust program to Wasm, add it to the toolchain.

    ```bash
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
    ```

**_Note:_** If you use Windows, download and install [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools).

## Creating your first Vara program

To get started, install the `sails-cli` tool using the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo install sails-cli
    ```

After installation, you can create a new Vara project named `vara-app` by running:

    ```bash
    cargo-sails new-program vara-app
    ```

Your `vara-app` directory tree should look like this:

    ```
    vara-app
    │
    ├── app
    │   └── src
    │       └── lib.rs
    │
    ├── client
    │   └── ...
    │
    ├── src
    │   └── lib.rs     
    │
    ├── tests
    │   └── gtest.rs
    │
    ├── build.rs
    │
    ├── Cargo.toml
    │
    └──  README.md
    ```
    
In `Cargo.toml`, the essential libraries required for building your first project have been included:

    ```rust title="vara-app/Cargo.toml"
    [workspace]

    members = ["client"]


    [package]
    name = "vara-app"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2021"

    [dependencies]
    vara-app-app = { path = "app" }

    [build-dependencies]
    vara-app-app = { path = "app" }
    sails-rs = { version = "0.4.0", features = ["wasm-builder"] }
    sails-idl-gen = "0.4.0"

    [dev-dependencies]
    vara-app = { path = ".", features = ["wasm-binary"] }
    vara-app-client = { path = "client" }
    sails-rs = { version = "0.4.0", features = ["gtest"] }
    tokio = { version = "1.39", features = ["rt", "macros"] }

    [features]
    wasm-binary = []
    ```

Let's move on to the main code:

This Rust code defines a simple program for the Vara Network, now updated with a new structure. The program consists of a `VaraAppProgram` struct with a method to instantiate it and another method to return a `VaraAppService` struct. The `VaraAppService` struct has a service method that returns the string *"Hello from VaraApp!"*. This example demonstrates the basic structure and functionality of a Vara program using the `sails_rs` library.

    ```rust title="vara-app/app/src/lib.rs"
    #![no_std]

    use sails_rs::prelude::*;

    struct VaraAppService(());

    #[sails_rs::service]
    impl VaraAppService {
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self(())
        }

        // Service's method (command)
        pub fn do_something(&mut self) -> String {
            "Hello from VaraApp!".to_string()
        }
    }

    pub struct VaraAppProgram(());

    #[sails_rs::program]
    impl VaraAppProgram {
        // Program's constructor
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self(())
        }

        // Exposed service
        pub fn vara_app(&self) -> VaraAppService {
            VaraAppService::new()
        }
    }
    ```

Build your program with a single command:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

After a successful build, you can execute your tests to verify that everything is functioning correctly:

    ```bash
    cargo test --release
    ```

If everything has been executed successfully, your working directory should now contain a `target` directory structured as follows:

    ```
    vara-app
    ├── ...
    ├── target
        ├── ...
        └── wasm32-unknown-unknown
            └── release
                ├── vara_app.wasm       <---- this is our built .wasm file
                ├── vara_app.opt.wasm   <---- this is optimized .wasm file
                └── vara_app.idl        <---- this is our application interface .idl file
    ```

- `vara_app.wasm` is the output Wasm binary built from source files
- `vara_app.opt.wasm` is the optimized Wasm aimed to be uploaded to the blockchain  
(Optimization include reducing the file size and improving performance)
- `vara_app.idl` is the Interface Definition Language (IDL) file that describes the application's interface, defining the structure and methods callable on the `vara_app` program. It’s essential for interacting with the application on the blockchain, specifying available functions and their inputs and outputs. This file is crucial for developers and clients to ensure they use the correct method signatures and data types when interacting with the deployed program.

## Deploy your program to the Testnet

Gear provides an application for developers (Gear Idea) that implements all of the possibilities of interaction with programs in Vara networks (mainnet and testnet), available at [idea.gear-tech.io](https://idea.gear-tech.io).

### Create account

1. Download the Polkadot extension for your browser via [https://polkadot.js.org/extension/](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/). This extension manages accounts and allows the signing of transactions with those accounts. It is a secure tool that allows injecting your accounts into any Substrate-based dapp. It does not perform wallet functions, e.g send funds.

2. Once downloaded, click <kbd>+</kbd> button to create a new account:
