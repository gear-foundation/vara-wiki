# Setting Up Vara Node

## Introduction

This guide covers the steps required to install and run the Vara node.

There are two ways to get started with the Vara node. First, download a pre-built binary file and run it. Second, compile the binary file and configure it manually. Using a ready-made build is a quick and convenient way to get started, as it skips the installation of Rust and all its dependencies and the node compiling process. Compiling the node from scratch may take about twenty minutes or more, depending on hardware.

## System Requirements

Vara node requires at least 64 GB of free space on an SSD disk.

## Install with Pre-built Binary

Depending on the operating system, download the latest release build of the node from https://get.gear.rs:

Terminal:

```bash
curl https://get.gear.rs/gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz | tar xJ
```

or

**Linux x86-64**: [gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz](https://get.gear.rs/gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz)

Run the node:

```bash
❯ ./gear --version
gear 1.2.1-a218853
```

or

**macOS ARM**: [gear-v1.2.1-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz](https://get.gear.rs/gear-v1.2.1-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz)

Run the node:

```bash
❯ ./gear --version

Run the node:

```bash
❯ ./gear --version
gear 1.2.1-a218853
```

<TabItem value="win64" label="Windows x86-64">

Terminal:

or

**Windows x86-64**: [gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip](https://get.gear.rs/gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip)

Unzip the downloaded package, then run the node:

```bash
❯ gear.exe --version
gear.exe 1.2.1-a218853
```

:::info

Nightly builds are available if the latest features are needed: [nightly builds](https://get.gear.rs/#gear-nightly).

:::

## Compile Node Manually

Compiling the build will take some time and requires the installation of some dependencies.

:::warning Note

Windows users may encounter some problems related to the installation of Rust components and dependencies.
It is highly recommended to use Linux or macOS for compiling Vara node and programs.

:::

### Prerequisites

Linux users should generally install `GCC` and `Clang`, according to their distribution’s documentation. Additionally, the `binaryen` toolset, which contains the required `wasm-opt` tool, should be installed.

For example, on Ubuntu use:

```bash
sudo apt install -y clang build-essential binaryen cmake protobuf-compiler
```

On macOS, get a compiler toolset and `binaryen` by running:

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install binaryen
```

### Install Rust

If Rust is already installed, skip this step.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Reboot the terminal after installation.

### Install Wasm Toolchains

```bash
rustup toolchain add nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

### Clone Gear Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gear-tech/gear.git
cd gear
# Checkout to the latest release tag
git checkout v1.2.1 -b release-1.2.1
```

:::info

To use the latest or experimental Gear Protocol's functions, compile the node from the `master` branch. It is the default branch after cloning, but switch back to the `master` branch using:

```bash
git checkout master
```

:::

### Compile

```bash
cargo build -p gear-cli --release
```

or

```bash
make node-release
```

:::note

The final build can be found at `gear/target/release/gear`.

Navigate to:

```bash
cd target/release
```

:::

## Run Vara Node

:::info

Regardless of whether the pre-built binary was downloaded or built manually, navigate to the directory where the node is installed and run it without special arguments to connect to the testnet:

:::

```bash
./gear
```

To run the Vara node in dev mode:

```bash
./gear --dev
```

## Command Flags and Options

```bash
gear [subcommand] [options]
```

- `--chain=testnet`

  Connect the node to the test network (default option).

- `--chain=vara`

  Connect the node to the Vara network.

- `--dev`

  Run a local node in development mode for testing purposes. This node will not be connected to any external network and will store the state in temporary storage.

- `purge-chain`

  Remove storage of the selected chain type. Specify the chain connection type `--chain=testnet`, `--chain=vara`, or `--dev`.

- `help`, `--help`

  Print the available subcommands/options or the help of the given subcommand.

## Special Environment Variables

To run the Vara node with logs from contracts:

```bash
RUST_LOG="gwasm=debug" gear [subcommand] [options]
```
