Nominators are passive participants of any `PoS consensus mechanism`. They are indirectly involved in maintaining the health and security of the network by sharing their tokens with the most reliable validators who are already engaged in confirming blocks. Nominators receive a reward for their bet, which depends on the network economy and on the percentage that the validator takes for himself.

Being a nominator does not require running a node of your own or worrying about online uptime.

## How to set up a nominator

To nominate your VARA tokens go to Polkadot.{js} app and navigate to Network → Staking → [Account actions](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.vara-network.io#/staking/actions) section and click `+Nominator`:

Select a validator (or validators) that you’d like to nominate. You can choose up to 16 validators and the algorithm will determinete how to nominate your funds for each Era in the most effective way.

It is worth choosing only reliable validators with a good reputation to be sure that they will not be slashed.
